# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple TypeScript application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a string in the input field provided.
3. Click the "Check Palindrome" button.
4. The result of the palindrome check will be displayed below the input field.

## Example

- Entering "racecar" will result in a message saying "'racecar' is a palindrome!".
- Entering "hello" will result in a message saying "'hello' is not a palindrome.".

## Limitations

- This checker ignores spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. So, for example, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" will be considered a palindrome.

## Credits

This palindrome checker is implemented using TypeScript and JavaScript.
