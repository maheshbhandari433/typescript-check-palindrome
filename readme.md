# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple JavaScript function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a string in the input field provided.
3. Click the "Check Palindrome" button.
4. An alert will display whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.

## Example

- Entering "racecar" will result in an alert saying "'racecar' is a palindrome!".
- Entering "hello" will result in an alert saying "'hello' is not a palindrome.".

## Limitations

- This checker ignores spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. So, for example, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" will be considered a palindrome.
